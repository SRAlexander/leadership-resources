# Charing meetings and presenting

## The 4Ps Model

The 4 Ps of presentation skills are a four-step process that can help ensure an effective presentation:

- Plan: Consider your audience and structure your presentation. You can use bullet points, mind maps, and message preparation sheets.
- Prepare: Consider how to make your message resonate.
- Practice: Practice your presentation skills with friends, family, and colleagues.
- Present: Get your body language right. 

Following these steps can help you deliver your presentation with confidence and engage your audience.

## Dartboard Model

Presenters routinely make the mistake of trying to cover far too much content in the time they have available. This can result in content being cut out in the spur of the moment, anxiety for the presenter and/or the presentation taking longer than planned. None of these situations are desirable and they can be avoided by prioritising the content.

1. Start with a very clear presentation objective - this is an essential first step
2. Generate a list of points that are relevant to meeting your presentation objective
3. Review this list using the Dartboard Model and categorise each item as Must Know, Should Know or Could Know
4. Structure your presentation around the Must Know items; reserve your information about the Should Knows to cover if you have spare time or to deal with in the Q&A section of your presentation. Leave out the Could Knows as they are not central to meeting your presentation objective.
