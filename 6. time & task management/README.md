## Learning Styles

### Stephen Covey's Time Management Matrix

A time management matrix is a methodology of planning your tasks according to their importance and deadline so that you can do them at the right time. They are based around the four priorities:-

 - Urgent/ Important = Necessity / Crisis
 - Not Urgent / Important = Productivity
 - Urgent / Not Important = Deception
 - Not Urgent / Not Important = Waste

### Prime Time

In time management, prime time refers to when a person is most productive and energised. There are two types:-

 - External prime time: The time that is particularly suitable for a task because of external factors.
 - Internal prime time: is the time when you are at your personal best for a task. Also known as biological prime time.

Note: Primetime facilitators usually find the effective use of “Time Boxing” beneficial.
