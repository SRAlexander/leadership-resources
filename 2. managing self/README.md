# Managing Self

## Honey and Mumford learning cycle

The Honey and Mumford, learning style model, is a way to understand how people learn and retain information. It's based on the idea that people have four different learning styles that they move through over time but eventually develop a preference for one or more. The four styles are: 

 - Activist: People who learn by doing and are open-minded and enthusiastic about new experiences 
 - Reflector: People who prefer to step back and view experiences from different perspectives 
 - Theorist: People who learn best by understanding the theory behind their actions and prefer thorough analysis 
 - Pragmatist: People who like to experiment with ideas and theories to see if they work in real-life situations 

As a line manager/leader, you should understand your natural learning style and be able to switch to different learning mindsets to adjust to new and other scenarios.

## Kolb

Experiential learning theory is about learning by doing. Developed by psychologist David Kolb, the theory describes the learning process whereby knowledge is created through experience. Kolb’s theory explains that concrete experience, reflective observation, abstract conceptualisation and active experimentation form a four-stage process (or cycle) transformed into effective learning. 

Kolb’s theory defines experiential learning as a four-stage process: 

 - Concrete learning occurs when a learner has a new experience or interprets a previous experience in a new way. For example, nursing students must learn a new procedure as part of their clinical education.
 - Reflective observation: The learner reflects on the new experience to understand what it means. In our example, the nursing student might think about how they could have done the procedure better.
 - Abstract conceptualisation: The learner adapts their thinking or constructs new ideas based on experience and reflection. For example, the nursing student realises they must have all their materials ready before starting the procedure.
 - Active experimentation: The learner applies their new ideas to real-world situations to test whether they work and see if any changes need to be made. This process can happen quickly or over an extended time. Our nursing students might note how smoothly things go consistently when they have everything ready for a procedure in advance.
