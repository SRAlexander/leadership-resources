# Communication Methods & Relationships

## Technique - Report Building

Rapport is the foundation of a meaningful relationship between two people. When you’re good at building rapport, you’re practiced at establishing a connection between yourself and someone else. Good rapport can make the other person feel respected, heard, and seen. It’s a great way to understand another person’s needs and support them. 

1. Find Common Ground

- Greet the person or make a remark to break the ice
- Find something you have in common
- Use open-ended questions to discover some personal information about the person
- Show interest in their life, work, hobbies, etc.
- Be sincere.

2. Show Empathy

- Notice any signals which tell you something about how the other person is feeling
- Respond to those signals
- Aim to see things from their perspective.

3. Mirror their Non-Verbal Communication

- Carefully watch the person’s body language (including gestures and posture) and mirror it without being too
obvious
- Mirror the other person’s language - e.g. use simple, direct words or technical language if they do
- Reiterate keywords or phrases that the other person has used
- Match their speech pattern in terms of vocal tone and volume
- Be subtle and be careful of mimicking the person.

4. Remember the Basics

- Shake hands firmly
- Look people in the eye
- Smile
- Hold your head up and maintain good posture
- Ask open-ended questions
- Be sincere
- Face the other person instead of looking at your computer screen or mobile device.

Note: these are the cultural norms in Western business and may not apply in every context.

## Technique - The Communication/Rapport Triangle

The Communications Triangle shows how people move between types of communication, from very safe topics (like the weather
and greetings), to deep and meaningful conversations, which imply a far higher level of vulnerability.
