## Reflective Techniques - Gibbs Reflective Cycle

Gibbs' Reflective Cycle was developed by Graham Gibbs in 1988 to give structure to learning from experiences.  It offers a framework for examining experiences, and given its cyclic nature lends itself particularly well to repeated experiences, allowing you to learn and plan from things that either went well or didn’t go well. It covers 6 stages:

- Description of the experience
- Feelings and thoughts about the experience
- Evaluation of the experience, both good and bad
- Analysis to make sense of the situation
- Conclusion about what you learned and what you could have done differently
- Action plan for how you would deal with similar situations in the future, or general changes you might find appropriate.

## Reflective Techniques - Johari Window

The Johari Window is a visual framework you can use to understand more about your conscious and unconscious biases. Doing this can improve your self-awareness and your understanding of others. But it can also be used as a personal development tool, and to build better workplace relationships. The window is divided into four quadrants:- 

- Open: The open area is that part of our conscious self – our attitudes, behavior, motivation, values, and way of life – that we are aware of and that is known to others. We move within this area with freedom. We are "open books".
- Blind: Adjectives not selected by subjects, but only by their peers go here. These represent what others perceive but the subject does not.
- Hidden: Adjectives selected by the subject, but not by any of their peers, go in this quadrant. These are things the peers are either unaware of, or that are untrue but for the subject's claim.
- Unknown: Adjectives that neither the subject nor the peers selected go here. They represent the subject's behaviors or motives that no one participating recognizes – either because they do not apply or because of collective ignorance of these traits.
